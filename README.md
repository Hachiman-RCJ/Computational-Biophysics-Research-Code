Investigating how motor protein (MP) transport is impacted by microtubule (MT) polarity flaws. 


I investigated how microtubule (MT) polarity flaws impact motor protein (MP) transport. Disrupted axonal MT arrays contribute to neurodegeneration in diseases like Alzheimer’s. In developing axons, most MTs have plus ends facing away from the cell body. I developed an agent-based simulation in MATLAB to model MP movement along MTs. MPs move preferentially along a MT until they (1) stochastically detach and reattach, (2) reach the MT end, or (3) collide with another MP, causing one to detach.
