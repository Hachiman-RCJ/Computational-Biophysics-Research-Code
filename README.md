I investigated how microtubule (MT) polarity flaws impact motor protein (MP) transport. Disrupted axonal MT arrays contribute to neurodegeneration in diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s. In developing axons, most MTs have plus ends facing away from the cell body. I developed an agent-based simulation in MATLAB to model MP movement along MTs. MPs move preferentially along a MT until they (1) stochastically detach and reattach, (2) reach the MT end, or (3) collide with another MP, causing one to detach.
